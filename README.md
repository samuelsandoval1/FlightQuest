## Story Behind the Project 🧠 
I was looking at brushing up my Python skills, so I decided to build a project that uses Pygame. Pygame is a Python wrapper that is widely used for game development and graphical interface programs. In this project, I made a simple game where users are on a quest to fly a plane using the arrow keys, and the objective is to fly through the many bombs in the air. When the user collides with a bomb, the game is over. \
 At the moment, this project isn't too developed; some future modifications I'd like to add are a scoring system and intro homepage that users see.
